The chat application we will be building today will be quite simple. It will include a login and logout system, AJAX-style features, and will also offer support for multiple users.

it is scripted using javascript library jQuery. it also has time stamp attached to the chats and the chats are always saved in a separate file. 

the styling is basic 

the chat supports auto scroll features and also auto update features.

how to run:
 
 1. install Xampp
 2. run apache from the Xampp control panel. also if you want you can run filezilla and mysql from the control panel.
 3. open the installation directory of xampp and navigate to htdocs folder
 4. now copy this entire repository to htdocs folder.
 5. now open your browser and type: localhost/Lavelle-Task1
 6. it will work.
